## Introduction

You are about to learn Python, a programming language that has become one of the most popular tools in software development, data analysis, automation, and scientific computing. Unlike languages designed decades ago with complex syntax, Python reads almost like English. This makes it an excellent first language for anyone learning to program.

Why does Python matter? Consider these everyday scenarios: a system administrator automates server backups instead of running them manually each night; a data analyst processes thousands of rows in a spreadsheet with a 10-line script instead of hours of clicking; a researcher simulates experiments that would be impossible to run physically. Python makes all of this possible without requiring years of training.

In this chapter, you will explore the Python environment installed on your computer. You will learn how to interact with Python directly through the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), how to write scripts in VS Code, and how to run programs from the command line. This foundation will support everything you build in the coming days.

## 1.1.1 What is Python?

Python is a general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. The language was designed with a clear philosophy: code should be readable, simple, and practical. Python achieves this through clean syntax that avoids unnecessary punctuation and enforces consistent formatting through indentation.

Python is interpreted, which means you do not need to compile your code before running it. You write a Python statement, execute it, and see the result immediately. This rapid feedback loop makes Python ideal for beginners and experienced developers alike. You can experiment, test ideas, and build working programs without the overhead of compilation steps.

The language comes with a comprehensive standard library — a collection of modules that handle common tasks like file operations, web requests, date manipulation, and mathematical calculations. When you install Python, you get these tools immediately. For specialized tasks, a vast ecosystem of third-party packages extends Python's capabilities into machine learning, web development, automation, and more.

**Key characteristics of Python:**

- **Readable syntax**: Code looks like structured English, not cryptic symbols
- **Dynamic typing**: You do not declare variable types; Python infers them
- **Interpreted execution**: No compilation step; write code and run it directly
- **Cross-platform**: Python runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux with the same code
- **Extensive libraries**: Thousands of packages available for nearly any task

## 1.1.2 Where is Python used?

Understanding where Python is applied helps you see its real-world value. Python is not a specialized tool for one domain — it spans industries and use cases.

**Web development**: Frameworks like Django and Flask power websites and APIs. Instagram, Spotify, and Dropbox rely on Python for backend services that handle millions of requests daily.

**Data analysis and science**: Libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib turn Python into a powerful tool for processing datasets, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing results. Scientists and analysts use Python to explore data and generate insights.

**Automation and scripting**: System administrators write Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks — backups, log analysis, server monitoring, batch file processing. A task that takes hours manually can run in seconds with a script.

**Machine learning and AI**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn make Python the dominant language in artificial intelligence research and deployment. Researchers prototype models quickly, then scale them to production.

**Education**: Python's simple syntax makes it the first language taught in universities and coding bootcamps worldwide. Learning programming concepts in Python transfers easily to other languages later.

**In practice:**

A typical Python user might write a script to rename hundreds of files in a folder, build a web scraper to collect product prices, analyze sales data from a CSV file, or create a command-line tool to automate a workflow. You will build similar practical programs in this training.

## 1.1.3 The Python REPL: Interactive programming

The Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive environment where you type Python code and see results immediately. This is one of Python's most powerful learning tools. Instead of writing an entire program, saving it, and running it, you can experiment line by line.

When you open a command prompt and type `python`, you enter the REPL. The prompt changes to `>>>`, indicating Python is ready for input. Type an expression, press Enter, and Python evaluates it and displays the result.

The following interaction shows basic REPL usage:

```python
>>> 5 + 3
8
>>> "Hello, World!"
'Hello, World!'
>>> 2 ** 10
1024
```

Notice that Python immediately evaluates each expression. You typed `5 + 3` and received `8`. You entered a string and Python echoed it back. You calculated 2 to the power of 10 and got 1024. This instant feedback accelerates learning.

The REPL is not just for arithmetic. You can define variables, call functions, import modules, and test code snippets. When you are unsure how something works, the REPL lets you try it immediately.

**Think about it:**

Before reading further, consider: Why would an interactive environment be valuable when learning a new programming concept? How does immediate feedback change the way you explore code compared to writing an entire program first?

The answer: Immediate feedback reduces friction. You test one idea at a time, see what works, and adjust. If something fails, you know exactly which line caused the problem. This iterative process builds confidence and understanding faster than writing large programs and debugging them later.

## 1.1.4 VS Code: Your code editor

While the REPL is excellent for quick experiments, you need a way to write, save, and edit longer programs. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source code editor that has become the most widely used development tool in the industry. It is already installed on your ALEF lab computer.

VS Code provides:

1. **The Editor**: A full-featured text editor where you write Python script files (files ending in `.py`). You get syntax highlighting, code completion, error detection, and automatic indentation.

2. **The integrated terminal**: A command prompt built into VS Code where you can run Python scripts, start the REPL, and use tools like pip and uv — all without leaving the editor.

3. **The Explorer**: A sidebar that shows your project files and folders, making it easy to navigate between scripts.

To create and run a Python script in VS Code:

1. Open VS Code. You can launch it from the Start menu or by typing `code` in a command prompt.
2. Open your working folder: **File → Open Folder**, then select `C:\labs`.
3. Create a new file: click the new-file icon in the Explorer sidebar, or press `Ctrl+N` and then save with `Ctrl+S`.
4. Write your code in the editor and save the file with a `.py` extension.
5. Open the integrated terminal: press `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick) or select **Terminal → New Terminal**.
6. Run your script in the terminal: type `python hello.py` and press Enter.

The following script demonstrates a simple program:

```python
# greet.py
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print("Welcome to Python programming.")
```

When you run this script, the terminal displays:

```
Hello, Alice!
Welcome to Python programming.
```

VS Code provides syntax highlighting (keywords appear in color), IntelliSense (code suggestions as you type), error underlining, and a rich extension ecosystem. You will use VS Code for all scripts throughout this training.

**Tip:**

If VS Code prompts you to install the Python extension when you open a `.py` file, click **Install**. This extension adds Python-specific features like code completion, linting, and debugging support. See [Python VS Code setup](../../additional-materials/python-vscode-setup.md) for detailed configuration steps.

## 1.1.5 Running Python from the command line

Beyond the REPL and VS Code, you can run Python programs directly from the command line. This is how scripts are typically executed in production environments, automation workflows, and on servers.

To run a Python script from the command line, navigate to the folder containing your script and execute:

```
C:\labs> python script.py
```

Python reads the file, executes each line in order, and displays any output. This approach is essential for scripts that run automatically (scheduled tasks, triggered by events, or called by other programs).

The command line also accepts flags and arguments. For example, `python --version` displays your Python version:

```
C:\labs> python --version
Python 3.12.1
```

Understanding command-line execution is crucial. Many Python tools and frameworks require you to run commands from a terminal. Package managers, testing tools, and build systems all operate this way.

**In practice:**

A data analyst might run `python analyze_sales.py` every morning to process yesterday's transactions. A system administrator might schedule `python backup.py` to run nightly. These scripts execute without human interaction, reading input from files and writing output to logs or databases.

**Note:**

The VS Code integrated terminal is a full command prompt. You can run all the same commands there — `python script.py`, `pip install`, `uv run` — without switching to a separate window. This makes VS Code a single workspace for both editing and executing code.

## 1.1.6 Common pitfalls

**Confusing the REPL prompt with code**

When you see `>>>` in examples, that is the REPL prompt, not part of the code you type. If you copy `>>>` into a script file, Python will produce a SyntaxError. Always copy only the code after the prompt:

```python
# In the REPL (you see this):
>>> print("Hello")
Hello

# In a script file (you write this):
print("Hello")
```

**PATH issues: "python is not recognized"**

If you type `python` and see an error message like "python is not recognized as an internal or external command," Python is not on your system PATH. This means Windows cannot find the Python executable. In the ALEF lab environment, Python is pre-configured on the PATH, but if you encounter this elsewhere, you need to reinstall Python with the "Add to PATH" option checked.

**Forgetting to save before running**

In VS Code, if you run a script from the terminal without saving first, you execute the old version of the file. Always save your file (`Ctrl+S`) before running. Look for the dot indicator on the file tab — it means the file has unsaved changes.

## Summary

In this chapter, you learned:

- Python is a readable, interpreted, general-purpose language used in web development, data analysis, automation, machine learning, and more
- The REPL provides an interactive environment where you type code and see results immediately
- VS Code is a professional code editor with syntax highlighting, code completion, and an integrated terminal
- Python scripts are plain text files ending in `.py` that execute from top to bottom
- You can run Python programs from VS Code's terminal or any command prompt (`python script.py`)

**Key syntax pattern:**

```python
# In the REPL
>>> expression
result

# In a script file
print("Output visible when script runs")

# From command line or VS Code terminal
C:\labs> python script.py
```
